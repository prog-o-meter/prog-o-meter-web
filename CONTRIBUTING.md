# Contributing Guide
Please note this is a work in progress, and I'm trying to get it as detailed as possible as quick as possible. 
If you find something that you think needs more explaining, please point it out, by opening an issue (see how below), and we will work on improving it. Please don't hold back, because you think that you're the only one who don't get it! Most likely, you are not, and everyone else will benefit from you pointing it out. But even if you were the only one, we would wanna improve it. This project is for everyone, also for you!

## How to contribute

### Try to use the prog-o-meter program
The first thing to do, would be opening the desktop version of our program and trying it out, so you know how it feels to use.
Check out this [user guide](https://github.com/prog-o-meter/prog-o-meter/blob/master/user_guide.md) for instructions on how to download and use the program.

### Find out what you wanna work on
If you look in the issues tab above, there will be a list of things to work on. Look through them, and see if anything catches your eye.
* If you find an issue that you think is interesting, but you aren't excactly sure how to get started, please leave a comment on the issue, and we can communicate on how to get started.
* If you find an issue that you think is interesting, and you know how to get started, please leave a comment, stating that you will be working on this, and assign yourself to the issue 
* If you have an idea for something to work on please add a new issue (see how below). If you know how to get started, just go ahead. If not, we will reply to your issue soon, and discuss how to get started on this task

### Get started
When you know what you wanna work on, it is time to start. We use the github workflow (video description [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBI2Rz-ZOxU)) I will write up a more thorough explanation of this in the future.

In the future, I intend to write a guide specifically for prog-o-meter, but for now, check out [this step-by-step tutorial by Jen Weber](https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6), on how to contribute (It assumes you have git installed, but it has a link to a tutorial, if you don't)

__NOTES:__
  * __STEP 3__: I am sorry the guide does not include any information on how to clone on Windows. I will try to find a guide as soon as possible.
  * __STEP 5__: The prog-o-meter is a VERY simple program written in Python 2.7, so you will need to have that installed.  Tkinter is included with most python installations, but if it isn't compiling/running when you download this, you can follow the instructions [here](http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) to get up and running.
  * __STEP 7__: We do not currently have any tests, so for now ignore this step. (If you are interested in working on writing tests, please let me now).
