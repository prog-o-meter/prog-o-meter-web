## About the Prog-o-meter
The prog-o-meter is for tracking your progress during a #100DaysofCode challenge (or any other #100DaysofX challenge). 
You get a graphic overview of how far you are in your challenge, since the prog-o-meter shows completed days and remaining days.
A desktop version of the prog-o-meter currently exists, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/prog-o-meter/prog-o-meter). 
In this repo, we are working on a web-based version of the prog-o-meter.

## Get involved
The prog-o-meter was started as a project for me to work on during a #100DaysofCode challenge.
I had been looking for an open-source project to contribute to, to get more experience with collaboration and git/github, but I found none that seemed right for me, and honestly, many of them looked too intimidating for me to even know where to start.
Suddenly it hit me, why don't I just start a new project. One that assumes no experience with collaboration on software. One where we  start from scratch, and learn by doing. One where we help each other out, while working on an awesome project, that will feel relevant to new programmers.

The prog-o-meter is made for newbies by a newbie, and I really want you to join. If you are interested, check out the issues for projects to work on. Or if you have an idea for improvement, either a new feature, or something that can be done better in an existing feature, feel more than welcome to open up a new issue, and work with us on improving the prog-o-meter.
If you feel just as overwhelmed as I did, when I was looking for open-source projects, __DO NOT WORRY__. Please open an issue (see how below) and give it as a title "Hi, my name is [your name]". In the comment, introduce yourself, tell me what you are interested in, and a bit about your experience, and I will help you find something to work on.
